THIS IS MY FIRST MINI C LANGUAGE PROGRAM!

Title: Matrix simple calculator

Author: Alexx William



1. This is a simple matrix calculator for a 3X3 order matrix.
2. It takes elements for two matrix A and B in the form of input and simply adds them to display the result in matrix form.
3. Elements must be entered in row-wise order for both matrix A and B.
4. It works fine with both negative and positive integers BUT not for fractional or decimal digits.
5. I'll sooner add tweaks for more mathematical operations as I learn more in my C programing journey!
